Code used in a publication on wildfires in Indonesia. It is developed to be run inside the [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) platform. You need to have both Google (Gmail) and Google Earth Engine accounts in order to use it.

The code allows studying the distribution of precipitation distribution for the whole Indonesia by making clusters from [ERA5 Monthly aggregates - Latest climate reanalysis produced by ECMWF / Copernicus Climate Change Service](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_MONTHLY) data.
